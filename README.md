## Design

#### Colours

![Colours Palete](./assets/readme/extras/color-panel.jpg)<br>

- The colour scheme is kept simple by opting for a combination of white text set against the image
background and black text set against the white background. The navbar was set on a white background
and a light grey on the bottom. The interactive colour is used for icons and the website logo.
Yellow is used for the "Buy Now" buttons and red is used to the "Discover More" buttons. The Dark grey was used for the
website footer. This contrasts with the rest of the website.

#### Typography

- The Montserrat font is used as the main font for the whole project. The Sofia Sans Condensed & Nanum Myeongjo font is used to display the website logo and some titles.
